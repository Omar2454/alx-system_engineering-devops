## Issue Summary
**Duration of Outage**: June 8, 2024, 14:00 - June 8, 2024, 16:00 (UTC)

**Impact**: 
- The main web application service was down.
- Approximately 80% of users experienced service disruption, leading to frustration and potentially life-altering reconsiderations.

**Root Cause**: 
- A misconfiguration in the load balancer caused an infinite loop of redirects, effectively turning it into a digital merry-go-round.

## Timeline
- **14:00**: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating high response times and increased error rates. Engineers collectively groan.
- **14:05**: Verification of the issue by an engineer noting an unusual number of HTTP 502 errors. 
- **14:10**: Initial investigation focuses on application servers, suspecting a deployment issue.
- **14:30**: Servers cleared of suspicion; investigation shifts to the database, which also proves innocent.
- **14:45**: Escalation to the network operations team after ruling out server and database issues.
- **15:00**: Network team identifies unusual traffic patterns suggesting a load balancer issue.
- **15:15**: Discovery of misconfigured redirect rules causing infinite loops in the load balancer.
- **15:30**: Configuration corrected, and load balancer restarted. 
- **15:45**: Service verified as restored and stable.
- **16:00**: Issue officially resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause**:
- The load balancer was misconfigured to create an infinite redirect loop. This resulted from a recent change aimed at optimizing traffic distribution but inadvertently led to a digital hamster wheel scenario.

**Resolution**:
1. Accessed the load balancer’s management console.
2. Identified and corrected the misconfigured redirect rules.
3. Restarted the load balancer to apply changes.
4. Monitored to ensure the fix was effective and no further issues were present.


## Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements/Fixes**:
1. **Configuration Review**: Implement a thorough review process for load balancer configurations to prevent future mishaps.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements**: Add specific alerts for unusual traffic patterns that could indicate configuration issues.
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation with clear guidelines on configuring load balancers, highlighting the potential pitfalls.

**Task List**:
1. **Patch Load Balancer Configuration**: Ensure the current configuration is correct and stable.
2. **Add Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring for redirect patterns and load balancer health.
3. **Conduct Training**: Organize training sessions for engineers on best practices for load balancer configurations.
4. **Review Process**: Establish a peer-review process for all critical configuration changes.
5. **Incident Response Plan**: Update the incident response plan to include steps for quickly identifying and resolving load balancer-related issues.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent future incidents and ensure our systems are as resilient as our engineers’ coffee addictions. Remember, failing is an opportunity to learn – just make sure you don't loop back to fail again.
