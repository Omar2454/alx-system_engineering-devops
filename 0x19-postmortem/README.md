Postmortem: The Case of the Infinite Loop
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage: June 8, 2024, 14:00 - June 8, 2024, 16:00 (UTC)
Impact: The main web application service was down, leaving users staring at an endless loading screen. About 80% of users were affected, experiencing extreme frustration and perhaps reconsidering their life choices.
Root Cause: The culprit was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, resulting in an infinite loop of redirects. Yes, we essentially turned our load balancer into a merry-go-round.

Timeline
14:00: Monitoring alert screams, "The site is down!" Engineers collectively groan.
14:05: Verification of the issue by an engineer who notes the site is indeed doing a fine impression of a black hole.
14:10: Initial assumption: “Must be the servers!” – Investigation into the application servers begins.
14:30: Servers appear innocent. The database is the next suspect but is found healthy and alibi-strong.
14:45: “This needs escalation!” The network operations team is called in.
15:00: Network team detects unusual traffic patterns, suspects foul play in the load balancer.
15:15: Discovery of the mischievous redirect loop in the load balancer settings.
15:30: Misconfiguration fixed, and the load balancer gets a reboot.
15:45: Site is back up, users breathe a sigh of relief (or maybe just us).
16:00: Issue declared resolved, engineers finally get their coffee.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: Our load balancer was misconfigured to perpetuate an endless cycle of redirects, causing HTTP 502 errors. Picture it like a hamster wheel, but for network traffic. This was a result of a recent change intended to optimize traffic distribution but instead optimized our stress levels.

Resolution: We stopped the redirect madness by:

Accessing the load balancer’s configuration.
Identifying and correcting the looping redirect rules.
Restarting the load balancer to clear its confusion.
Monitoring to ensure the fix was effective and everything was back to normal (no more merry-go-rounds).
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Configuration Review: Implement a thorough review process for load balancer configurations. No more rogue redirects on our watch!
Monitoring Enhancements: Add specific alerts for unusual traffic patterns indicative of configuration loops. Think of it as a smoke alarm for our load balancer.
Documentation: Improve and update documentation on load balancer configurations with a big, bold “DO NOT CREATE LOOPS” section.
Task List:

Patch Load Balancer Configuration: Double-check and ensure no residual misconfigurations exist.
Add Monitoring: Set up enhanced monitoring for redirect patterns and load balancer health.
Conduct Training: Organize training for engineers on the dos and don’ts of load balancer configurations. Offer donuts as an incentive.
Review Process: Establish a peer-review process for critical configuration changes. Two heads are better than one, especially when preventing infinite loops.
Incident Response Plan: Update our incident response plan to quickly identify and resolve load balancer issues in the future.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent future incidents and ensure our systems are as resilient as our engineers’ coffee addictions. Failing is an opportunity to learn – just make sure you don't loop back to fail again.
